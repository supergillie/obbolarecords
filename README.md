DNS stands for Domain Name System. Think of it as the internet's phonebook. Every website has a unique IP address, which is a series of numbers like "192.168.1.1". But typing in numbers to visit websites would be tedious and hard to remember.

So, instead of typing in a long string of numbers, you type in a web address like "google.com". The DNS system takes that name and translates it into the IP address associated with that name. This way, you're directed to the correct website.

It's a system that makes navigating the internet user-friendly by allowing us to use memorable domain names instead of numerical IP addresses.
